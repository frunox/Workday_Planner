# Workday_Planner

Created March 12, 2020, by John Cannon

We commented on the code in the .html, .js, and .css files.

We also added a modal popup to appear when there is a task in the 'next' hour (currentHour + 1).
To get it to work while we were creating it, we forced it to look at the 9am and 10am textboxes, and entered a task for only 10am.
There are comments in the .js file indicating how to change the code to run at all times.
